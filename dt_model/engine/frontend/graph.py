Computation Graph Building
==========================

This module allows to build an abstract computation graph using TensorFlow-like
computation primitives and concepts. These primitives and concepts are also similar
to NumPy primitives, with minor naming differences.

This module provides:

1. Basic node types for constants and placeholders
2. Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
3. Comparison operations (equal, not_equal, less, less_equal, greater, greater_equal)
4. Logical operations (and, or, xor, not)
5. Mathematical operations (exp, power, log)
6. Shape manipulation operations (expand_dims, squeeze)
7. Reduction operations (sum, mean)

The nodes form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents computations
to be performed. Each node implements a specific operation and stores its
inputs as attributes. The graph can then be evaluated by traversing the nodes
and performing their operations using NumPy, TensorFlow, etc.

Here's an example of what you can do with this module:

    >>> from dt_model.engine.frontend import graph
    >>> a = graph.placeholder("a", 1.0)
    >>> b = graph.constant(2.0)
    >>> c = graph.add(a, b)
    >>> d = grap.multiply(c, c)

Like TensorFlow, we support placeholders. That is, variables with a given
name that can be filled in at execution time with concrete values. We also
support constants, which must be bool, float, or int scalars.

Because our goal is to *capture* the arguments provided to function invocations
for later evaluation, we are using classes instead of functions. (We could
alternatively have used closures, but it would have been more clumsy.) To keep
the invoked entities names as close as possible to TensorFlow, we named the
classes using snake_case rather than CamelCase. This is a pragmatic and conscious
choice: violating PEP8 to produce code that reads like TensorFlow.

The main type in this module is the `Node`, representing a node in the
computation graph. Each operation (e.g., `add`) is a subclass of the `Node`
capturing the arguments it has been provided on construction.

Design Decisions
----------------

1. Class-based vs Function-based:
   - Classes capture operation arguments naturally
   - Enable visitor pattern for transformations
   - Allow future addition of operation-specific attributes

2. Snake Case Operation Names:
   - Match NumPy/TensorFlow conventions
   - Improve readability in mathematical context

3. Node Identity:
   - Nodes are identified by their instance identity
   - Enables graph traversal and transformation

    Design Notes
    ------------

    1. Identity Semantics:
        - Nodes use identity-based hashing and equality
        - This allows graph traversal algorithms to work correctly
        - Enables use of nodes as dictionary and sets keys

    2. Debug Support:
        - Nodes carry flags for debugging (trace/break)
        - Names for better error reporting
        - Extensible flag system for future debug features
